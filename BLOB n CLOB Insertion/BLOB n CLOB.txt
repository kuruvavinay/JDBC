There are 2 types of large objects 
BLOB(Binary Large Object) -> images,videos...the datatype is largeblob
CLOB(Character Large Object) ->text files,pdf etc..

Insering image into sql with java
----------------------------------
using scanner we should give the input of image location
using PreparedStatement..we use methods like setString(),setInt() for strings and int types respectively.
In case of blobs..we use setBinaryStream..
pstmt.setBinaryStream(3,FileInputStream(new File(imgloc)));

FileInputStream is for reading data from a file in the form of bytes.

In case of CLOB...we use setCharacterStream and since they're chars we use FileReader.
pstmt.setCharacterStream(3,FileReader(new File(pdfloc)));
