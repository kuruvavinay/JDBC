TYPES of RESULT SET
--------------------
Division - 1 :

1.Read-Only ResultSet(static RS)
2.Updatable ResultSet(dynamic RS)

Division - 2:

1.Forward only ResultSet(Non-Scrollable)
2.Scrollable RS
	a.Scroll Insensitive RS
	b.Scroll Sensitive RS

By default...ResultSet is Static and Non-Scrollable

To specify resultSet to act as scrollable we shud mention some methods in statement itself.

ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE

we use resultSet.next() to move the resultSet pointer in fwd direction till the records exist.

After that since the pointer is at last record of the table...we can use resultSet.prev() to move in backward direction

resultSet.first() -> to move the pointer to first record.

resultSet.last() -> to move the pointer to last record.

resultSet.absolute(4) -> from the beginning 4th row is selected

resultSet.relative(2) -> from the current pointer...selects 2nd row..let's say with absolute(4) we're now at 4th row..and it selects 2nd row from 4 which is 6th row.

if the val provided is negative then it will move in backward direction.

resultSet.relative(-2) -> this will select 2nd row from the 4th row in backward direction which is 2nd row.

resultSet.last() & resultSet.absolute(-1) are same
