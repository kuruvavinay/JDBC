For a query to be exceute completely..time taking includes..(request time+compilation time+execution time+response time)

using normal statement..same query should compile everytime when the value changes..
For ex..the query is like select * from id=8..in this query the id may change sometime but the query is same.

For increasing performance..we use PreparedStatement...also called PreCompiled Query
the query corresponding to prepare statement is like..

String sqlnonselectquery="insert into student('name','branch','marks') values(?,?,?)
qn marks can be treated as col no's starting from 1.
PreparedStatement pstmt=con.prepareStatement(sqlnonselectquery);
to set the values
pstmt.setString(1,"Vinay")-> 1 is a col no.
pstmt.setString(2,"CSE")
pstmt.setInt(3,50)
since it's a non-select query we use executeUpdate()
int affected=pstmt.executeUpdate();
