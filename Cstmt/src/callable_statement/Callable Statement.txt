In programming if any code is to be execute repeatedly...we those lines under a method.
Likewise in db prgming...if grp of sql stmts are required repeatedly we group those lines called STORED PROCEDURES.

-> stored permanently inside db for future usage.
-> creaded by DataBase Admin(DBA)

IN sql...there's a lang to create Stored Procedure called Stored Procedure Language.

3 Parameters
-> IN (provide input val)
-> OUT (provide output val)
-> INOUT (to provide and to collect op)

Example
--------
DELIMITER $$
CREATE 
	PROCEDURE `me`.`E_GET_EMPLOYEE_DETAILS_BY_ID`(IN eid INT,OUT ename varchar(255),OUT eage int)
    BEGIN
		SELECT name,age into ename,eage from emp where eid=id;
	END$$
DELIMITER ;

Similar to calling a method in programming...we call this Stored Procedure using CALL.

CALL `E_GET_EMPLOYEE_DETAILS_BY_ID`(7,@ename,@eage);

and then using select display the result

select @ename,@eage;


In this example we used ID as an IN parameter...which will generally be unique
we should mention the id whenever we CALL the procedure...

In jdbc...the CALL should be inside {}(braces)
We've a method prepareCall...to connect to the given procedureCall with Callble Stmt.
For the OUT parameters...we shud use the method registerOutParameter

instead executeQuery() and executeUpdate()...we should use execute() for storedProcedures.
Since it's neither a select query nor a non-select query.

To retrieve those values with diff datatypes...for ex if there are int in both java and sql.

But there are String and varchar which peforms same thing bt diff datatypes..
To resolve this..we use jdbc datatypes...which are TYPES.INTEGER,VARCHAR etc....
